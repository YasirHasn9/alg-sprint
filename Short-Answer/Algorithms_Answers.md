#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) runtime is O(logn)
because if we assume that n = 4 
while a < 4*4*4:
    a = 0 + 4*4
    print(a)
output:
16
32
48
64
this will run 4 times logarithmically  way not linearly 


b) runtime is O(n^2) 
because the nested while loop inside the for loop will make it run double the n size


c) ) runtime is O(n)
     because of the recursive function that technically relies of the input size
     of bunnies(n size)
